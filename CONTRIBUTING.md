## **structured system for contributing to dsc-site**

1. If you want to change something in a section that someone else is working on create an `issue` first if that person is not able to do those changes they are free to `assign the issue` to that person who raised the `issue`

2. If you are doing contributing to the site create a new branch from the latest main branch and do your changes to the newly created branch.

3. Add your `name as an author` to the `JS file` you are working on so that others do not alter the code instead `create an issue` first.

4. If you are installing some new `packages` install them to `main` branch first and commit the changes and then do the same to `your branch` (all this to create less conflicts to the `package.json` and avoid `build check failures`).
